					<h1>What Sciences Say About Exercise Vs Diet For Weight Loss</h1>

					<p>
						What is responsible for the obesity epidemic in this country? Would you say a sedentary lifestyle with a lack of exercise or poor diet? In the past thirty years, obesity rates have skyrocketed. Many would say it is the endless array of highly processed foods and sugary soft drinks that have caused the epidemic while others might go with a lack of physical activity.
					</p>

					<p>
						Physical activity is important for reducing the risk of dementia, heart disease and other health conditions, however it is not enough to promote weight loss. While obesity rates have increased over the past thirty years, there has been little change in physical activity in the U.S. This indicates that it is what we are eating that is getting us in trouble and overweight.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unfortunately, many people believe that obesity is caused by a lack of exercise. That fact is you cannot flee or outrun bad eating habits. In other words, you can exercise for hours every day but if your eating habits are not healthy, then obesity can take over quickly. The old saying, “you are what you eat” is really true. What has changed a bit over the years is advocating eating foods that are high in fat and low in carbohydrates and sugar. Many exercisers and athletes have given up the high-carbohydrate diet and eat more fat. It appears that fat, including ketone bodies, appear to be the best fuel for exercise.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of the best tactics for losing weight is to stop drinking the sugary drinks and avoid junk food at all costs. Did you know that many food manufacturers add chemicals to their foods that actually can make you become addicted to that particular food or beverage? It is true. A healthy lifestyle includes both exercise and a well-balanced diet. Weight loss programs that combine both physical activity and healthy eating are the most successful.
					</p>

					<p>
						It was concluded at the National Obesity Forum that the junk food industry including beverages has known for years what they need to do to make their products healthy, but are not taking responsibility and making the necessary changes. It does seem a bit ridiculous when you see a major junk food beverage sponsoring an athletic event knowing full well that if the athletes consumed their product, they would be able to perform at their fitness best. Funding sporting events make corporations feel good about their company and of course, it is good for business. It really is about the almighty dollar.
					</p>

					<p>
						You can take a stand and eat more foods in their whole, healthy raw state. If a food or beverage has more than five ingredients and does not have an expiration date, it is not something you want to eat. The number one thing you can do to make a change in your health is to avoid sugar and keep exercising. When it comes to exercise verses diet, it really is never one or the other for long-term successful weight loss. You can always cut down on calories and exercise more to get ready for a special event or occasion but what happens when the event has come and gone?
					</p>

					<p>
						Think of your body as a high-performance car. If you put in low-quality fuel, the engine in the car will not run very well or for too long. It really is as simple as that. Instead of debating over which is best, exercise or dieting, join a fitness center and exercise to go along with your healthy eating. It really is the best of both worlds.
