						If you don't receive our email, remember to always check your junk / spam email box as your mail provider or spam blocker may be incorrectly filtering our email as spam or bulk mail.
					</p>

					<p>
						Remember to add info@notjustdietplans.org to your Contacts in your mail such that all emails land straight to your Inbox.
					</p>

					<h4>3. <a class="post__faq-achor" id="njdp_3">How do I change my password?</a></h4>

					<hr>

					<h4>1. <a class="post__faq-achor" id="Download_Related_Help_1">Why do I get the message "Internet Explorer is not able to open the internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found." while trying to download the product and the other information. How do I report such a site error?</a></h4>

					<p>
						Ans : We are sorry for your inconvenience.You can refresh the screen for a few times or wait for a few minutes and try later. Sometimes a number of open programs may also hinder the customer from entering into our site. Close some of the programs and try again.
					</p>

					<p>
						We would also suggest to try to access the website with another browser, like Firefox or Google Chrome.
					</p>

					<p>
						Whilst we have made every effort to ensure that this website is error free, there will undoubtedly be occasions where an error has slipped through the net. If you wish to report any errors on this site, please Contact Us and send us a description of the error. We'll correct them as quickly as possible.
					</p>

					<h4>2. <a class="post__faq-achor" id="Download_Related_Help_2">How do I download my books and articles?</a></h4>

					<p>
						Ans: After you login, click on Books in the top menu. The three main e-books and five bonus e-books, included in the Not Just Diet Plans program, are listed with a green Download button beside each title. Since all these ebooks are PDF documents, you need not to be online every time you want to read them. You can easily download the books and read them from your system even when you’re offline. Note that in order to be able to read a PDF file, you must have Adobe Reader (a PDF reading program) installed on your computer.
					</p>

					<p>
						To download the books, select BOOKS tab from the top menu and right-click the Download button next to your book of choice. You will be prompted to save the file in your computer. Click on "Save As" or "Save Target As" to save the file. PLEASE remember the name of the folder in your computer where you are storing the files.
					</p>

					<p>
						You can access diet and weight loss related articles included in NJDP program by clicking on Articles link from the bottom menu. However, these articles are NOT for download. You can select an article from the list by clicking on its title and read them online.
					</p>

					<h4>3. <a class="post__faq-achor" id="Download_Related_Help_3">I couldn't download the entire book. What do I do now?</a></h4>

					<p>
						Ans: Probably, this is due to the bandwidth problem. Our bandwidth is not infinite. At all times, there are roughly 250-500 file transfers going on simultaneously. If everyone downloads many files at the same time, you can well imagine that the average download speed per person would be worse. Download only ONE book at a time. Do not use download boosters such as Download Accelerator. If you're still having troubles downloading our product, please contact us here.
